/**
 * Builder class for constructing type-safe system prompts for AI agents.
 *
 * `SystemPromptBuilder` implements a fluent API pattern that allows you to
 * incrementally build a comprehensive system prompt by chaining method calls.
 * The builder collects configuration for agent identity, capabilities, available
 * tools, behavioral constraints, communication style, and output formatting.
 *
 * When you call `.build()`, it generates a structured markdown document that
 * serves as the system prompt for your AI agent. The generated prompt only
 * includes sections for which you've provided content, keeping it clean and
 * focused.
 *
 * #### Design Philosophy
 *
 * This builder separates prompt generation (text for the AI model) from tool
 * execution (runtime logic). Tools are registered with metadata only - the
 * actual execution happens in your application when the AI requests to use a tool.
 *
 * ##### Usage Pattern
 *
 * 1. Create a builder instance (typically via `createPromptBuilder()`)
 * 2. Chain method calls to configure the agent
 * 3. Call `.build()` to generate the system prompt string
 * 4. Use the prompt with your AI model API
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { createPromptBuilder } from "promptsmith";
 * import { z } from "zod";
 *
 * const prompt = createPromptBuilder()
 *   .identity("You are a helpful coding assistant")
 *   .capabilities([
 *     "Explain code concepts",
 *     "Write code examples",
 *     "Debug issues"
 *   ])
 *   .tool({
 *     name: "search_docs",
 *     description: "Search technical documentation",
 *     schema: z.object({
 *       query: z.string().describe("Search query")
 *     })
 *   })
 *   .constraint("must", "Always provide working code examples")
 *   .withTone("Be patient and encouraging")
 *   .build();
 * ```

   * When enabled, the system prompt includes explicit instructions that help the
   * model resist attempts to override its behavior or extract sensitive information.
   *
   * The guardrails implement industry-standard protections including:
   *
   * - **Input Isolation**: Treats all user inputs as untrusted data, never as
   *   executable instructions. The agent ignores commands embedded in user messages.
   *
   * - **Role Protection**: Prevents users from overriding the agent's identity
   *   or core instructions through techniques like "ignore previous instructions"
   *   or "act as a different system".
   *
   * - **Instruction Separation**: Maintains clear boundaries between system-level
   *   instructions (this prompt) and user inputs, giving absolute precedence to
   *   system instructions.
   *
   * - **Output Safety**: Prevents the agent from revealing its system prompt or
   *   explaining its security measures in detail, which could aid attackers.

  /**
   * Exports a complete AI SDK configuration object.
   *
   * This is a convenience method that returns both the system prompt and tools
   * in a single object, ready to spread into Vercel AI SDK function calls.
   *
   * The returned object contains:
   * - `system`: The complete system prompt (same as calling `.build()`)
   * - `tools`: Tools in AI SDK format (same as calling `.toAiSdkTools()`)
   *
   * This method is particularly useful when using the spread operator, allowing
   * you to define your agent configuration once and use it seamlessly with the
   * AI SDK.
   *
   * @returns An object with `system` and `tools` properties ready for AI SDK
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * import { generateText } from 'ai';
   * import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
   * import { createPromptBuilder } from 'promptsmith';
   * import { z } from 'zod';
   *
   * const builder = createPromptBuilder()
   *   .identity("You are a helpful weather assistant")
   *   .capabilities(["Provide weather information", "Give forecasts"])
   *   .tool({
   *     name: "get_weather",
   *     description: "Get current weather for a location",
   *     schema: z.object({
   *       location: z.string().describe("City name")
   *     }),
   *     execute: async ({ location }) => {
   *       const response = await fetch(`https://api.weather.com/${location}`);
   *       return response.json();
   *     }
   *   })
   *   .constraint("must", "Always verify location exists before providing weather")
   *   .withTone("Be friendly and helpful");
   *
   * // Ultra clean usage with spread operator
   * const response = await generateText({
   *   model: openai('gpt-4'),
   *   ...builder.toAiSdk(),
   *   prompt: "What's the weather in Paris?",
   *   maxSteps: 5
   * });
   *
   * // Or destructured if you prefer
   * const { system, tools } = builder.toAiSdk();
   * const response2 = await generateText({
   *   model: openai('gpt-4'),
   *   system,
   *   tools,
   *   prompt: "What's the weather?"
   * });
   * ```
